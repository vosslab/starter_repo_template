- Trimmed `propagate_style_guides.py` to stop editing existing `AGENTS.md` files in target repositories while keeping a no-overwrite bootstrap copy when `AGENTS.md` is missing.
- Added a no-overwrite style file category in `propagate_style_guides.py` so `AGENTS.md` and `docs/AUTHORS.md` are copied only when absent and never updated in-place.
- Updated `propagate_style_guides.py` default source lookup/help text to use `<base>/starter_repo_template` instead of `<base>/junk-drawer`.
- Clarified in `README.md` that only `README.md` and `docs/CHANGELOG.md` are repo-specific, while other files are intended to remain generic template infrastructure.
- Standardized `README.md` with a concise infrastructure-focused overview, curated `docs/` links, and a verifiable quick-start test command.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to direct AI agents to run commands with `bash -lc` (not Zsh) so `source_me.sh` works with expected shell semantics.
